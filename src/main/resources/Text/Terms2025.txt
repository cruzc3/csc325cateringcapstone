Terms and Conditions – JACK’s Catering Services (2025 Edition)

Last updated: April 25, 2025

Welcome to JACK’s Catering Services! By hiring us, nibbling our appetizers, or just sniffing the buffet
line, you agree to the following terms:

1. Booking & Payment
A 50% deposit is required at the time of booking to reserve your date. Without it, your event date is
about as secure as a soufflé in a thunderstorm.

Full payment is due no later than 5 days before the event. We accept cash, card, or barter
 if you own a taco truck).

2. Cancellations & Refunds
Cancellations made more than 14 days before the event will receive a full refund (minus a small
heartbreak fee).

Cancellations made within 7 days will result in a 50% refund.

Same-day cancellations? Sorry—your food is probably already in the oven.

3. Menu Changes
Menu changes can be made up to 10 days before your event. After that, your menu is locked in
like a well-marinated brisket.

4. Allergies & Dietary Restrictions
We do our best to accommodate allergies and dietary needs. However, our kitchen is not 100% free
from nuts, gluten, or sarcasm.

Guests with life-threatening allergies should consult a medical professional. We are food artists,
not wizards.

5. On-Site Behavior
We ask that guests treat our staff with the same respect they give to the dessert table. Rudeness may
result in mysteriously smaller portions.

JACK’s team reserves the right to pack up and leave if conditions become unsafe or unreasonably
unpleasant (e.g., food fights, karaoke emergencies).

6. Leftovers
Leftovers belong to the client unless otherwise agreed upon. We’re not in the business of hoarding extra
 liders (well, not officially).

JACK’s is not responsible for any food consumed after 2 hours of serving or left unattended in
suspicious containers.

7. Weather & Acts of God
Outdoor events are weather-permitting. JACK’s is not responsible for rain, snow, or rogue raccoons
unless explicitly contracted as part of the entertainment.

8. Photo & Media Release
We may photograph our food at your event for promotional use unless you opt out in writing.
Don’t worry—we'll keep your uncle’s interpretive dance moves off our Instagram.

9. Liability
JACK’s Catering is not liable for guest satisfaction based on unrealistic expectations inspired by
cooking shows.

Client agrees not to sue us if the mac & cheese is "too cheesy." That’s kind of the point.

10. Final Note
By hiring JACK’s Catering Services, you acknowledge that you’ve read, laughed, and legally accepted
 these terms. We look forward to feeding you!
